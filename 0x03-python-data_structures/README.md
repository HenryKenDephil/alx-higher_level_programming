data structures: lists, tupes.
this exercise explores lists operations and tuples.
some of the concepts covered here include:
list.append(x) that adds item to the end of the list
list.extend(iterable) that extends the list by appending all the items from the iterable
list.insert
list.remove
list.pop([i]) that removes item at the given position inthe list and return it
list.clear that removes all items from the list
list.index(x[, start[, end]]) that returns zero-based index
list.count(x)
list.sort
list.reverse
list.copy
